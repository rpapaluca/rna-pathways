## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have seen how to perform gene set testing various R packages. These methods help identify enriched gene ontology categories and gene sets, providing insights into the biological processes and pathways involved in the differential expression of genes. By using multiple methods, we can gain insights into the pathways involved in the biological processes of interest.
